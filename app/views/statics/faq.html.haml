					%h2 What is Smileku?
					%p Smileku is a place for crowd sourced storytelling. Our mission is to explore the boundaries of creative writing and journalism using social web technology. We believe sharing stories with people around the world will help make us a better connected and more compassionate society. We're looking for writers who feel the same way.
				%li 
					%h2 How does it work?
					%p At the core of Smileku is the ku. Kus are units of text that belong to a story. Anyone can add a ku to a story, and readers comment and cast votes for their favorite ones. As stories mature, the most popular kus show up first, shaping the way the story is read.
