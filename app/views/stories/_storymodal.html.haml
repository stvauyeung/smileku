		%h3 The basics
		%p Starting a new story on Smileku is easy. As the creator of a story, you must provide four things.  After the story is created, anyone can contribute kus and continue where you left off.  Start with:
		%dl
			%dt Title
			%dd Give your story a title. Good titles provide cues on what a story is about and people might add to them.
			%dt Description
			%dd You can use the description to set up characters in your story, link to references, or give more context behind what the story is about.  Future writers will see it as a starting point when adding to your story.
			%dt Cover Image
			%dd All stories have covers.  Be creative, a picture is worth a thousand words!
			%dt Body
			%dd This is where you write the first Ku in your story. Don't worry, you'll do great.
