		%h3 The basics
		%p Starting a new story on Smileku is easy. You must provide four things as the story creator:
		%dl
			%dt Title
			%dd Every story needs a title. Good titles provide cues on what a story is about and how people might add to them.
			%dt Description
			%dd Descriptions can be used to create characters, link to references, or provide background information.  Writers will see it as a starting point when adding to your story.
			%dt Cover Image
			%dd All stories have covers.  Be creative, a picture is worth a thousand words!
			%dt Body
			%dd This is where you write the first ku in your story. Don't worry, you'll do great.
		%h3 Text formatting
		%p= "Story description and ku body text can be styled using #{ link_to 'markdown', 'http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics', target: '_blank'} and both support #{ link_to 'emojis', 'http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/', target: '_blank'}.  This is awfully exciting stuff, so feel free to go crazy. But not too crazy.".html_safe
		%p Allright, enough reading. Go start that story!
