      <h2>What is Smileku?</h2>
          <p>Smileku is a novel way to write. Here, people around the world come together to co-author stories.</p>
          <p>Each story begins with a 500 word block known as a Ku. After the first Ku, anyone can add additional Kus to the story.  As the story grows, readers vote on their favorite Kus and in turn shape how the story is read.</p>
